It could be expected that the animals presence and display under normal circumstances would have elicited a response from the person to vacate the site. In this instance, the person is a commercial fisherman and was motivated to remain at the location to retrieve his harvest. I would not interpret the animal behaviour as an attack as the initial interaction was characteristic of a territorial display in crocodiles. The second interaction was not characteristic of an attack in that the animal did not lunge at the vessel or occupant with any speed nor did it inflict or attempt to inflict any bites to the vessel, outboard or person. The behaviour in the secondary interaction is more likely to have been motivated by the presence of food (fish) and an endeavour to recover the fish from the vessel. DERM has received 2 reports earlier this week regarding a 13-15 foot crocodile in Russell creek exhibiting behaviour indicating familiarity with vessels. The reports further allege that a commercial crab tour operator may be feeding the crocodile which in turn could be the source of the behaviour escalation in the animal.

Marty has advised that the creek is used for various activties including pumping water, cattle crossing, and a place to swim during the warmer months. 
Marty also has concerns that other crocodiles may be in the area, despite no evidence of this. Marty has made this suggestion based on a few young cattle going missing, and the presence of other predators in the area being low (mainly dingoes due to trapping programs). 
Whilst there are no known physical barriers in place to stop crocodiles from moving into the area, the surrounding landscape could provide some natural barriers. Not withstanding this, the area could be a major flood plain with potential for animals to move into areas during high floods.
